## This is my first brackish project

This content was rendered from a `README.md`

### Contents

```
testdir/
  .git
  Bracker.ipynb
  README.md
  fourier_animated.py
  gallery.json
  requirements.conda
  sliders.py
```

#### File breakdown

  * `.git` - This is a git repo. Package storage is not an issue with Brackish. This could also be a tarfile like kapsel execution expects. but it is not required.
  * `Bracker.ipynb` - A small notebook I wrote.
  * `README.md` - You are reading it now.
  * `fourier_animated.py` - A bokeh app
  * `gallery.json` - The apps and pages I want to add to the gallery.  
  * `requirements.conda` - The conda environment spec that we need to run the apps
  * `sliders.py` - Another bokeh app

## Summary

* Itâ€™s a Native app 
* It's a web app 
* Navigator like
    * But reusable components can be easily used across the web.
* Valid replacement plan for AEN.
* Fine grained Permissions are already an option.
* Deploy anywhere! heroku, docker could, aws, adam etc.
* Uses conda 
* Already almost done.
* Integrates compoenents without being coupled to them
    * Navigator / Conda / Anaconda.org 
* Workflow, how does the current kapsel execution expect to handle user mistakes? 
   * Users are expected to completley redeploy the app without being able to test it locally.
